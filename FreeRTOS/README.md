[Japanese](READMEja.md)

## Overview

Code porting the Amazon FreeRTOS kernel for RX microcomputers, the body of the kernel and modified code.      
   
The original code is aimed at the genuine Renesas compiler CC-RX/GNU-RX and frameworks.   
The original code is for the genuine Renesas compilers CC-RX/GNU-RX and frameworks, so we have removed the related code from the kernel source to reduce the dependency of the development environment.   

The code is basically for gcc.

## About the RX24T, RX220 heap size

- There is a project for the RX24T, but be aware that the RX24T,RX220's internal memory is small, so be careful when using it in practice.   
- The size can be changed in the RX220/Makefile's environment variable settings.   
- The size can be changed in the RX24T/Makefile's environment variable settings.   
　　　
```
#define configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE			( ( size_t ) ( RTOS_HEAP_SIZE * 1024 ) )
``` 
   
This setting is valid if you use the memory model "Source/portable/MemMang/heap_1.c".   

Other microcontrollers use malloc/free memory allocation, so memory is allocated dynamically.

## Kernel Modifiers

### port.c

- Source/portable/GCC/RX600/port.c
- Source/portable/GCC/RX600v2/port.c
- Source/portable/GCC/RX700v3_DPFPU/port.c

```
/* Hardware specifics. */
#if ( configINCLUDE_PLATFORM_H_INSTEAD_OF_IODEFINE_H == 1 )

    #include "platform.h"

#else /* configINCLUDE_PLATFORM_H_INSTEAD_OF_IODEFINE_H */

///    #include "iodefine.h"

#endif /* configINCLUDE_PLATFORM_H_INSTEAD_OF_IODEFINE_H */

...

BaseType_t xPortStartScheduler( void )
{
    extern void vApplicationSetupTimerInterrupt( void );

    /* Use pxCurrentTCB just so it does not get optimised away. */
    if( pxCurrentTCB != NULL )
    {
        /* Call an application function to set up the timer that will generate the
         * tick interrupt.  This way the application can decide which peripheral to
         * use.  A demo application is provided to show a suitable example. */
        vApplicationSetupTimerInterrupt();

        /* Enable the software interrupt. */
///        _IEN( _ICU_SWINT ) = 1;

        /* Ensure the software interrupt is clear. */
///        _IR( _ICU_SWINT ) = 0;

        /* Ensure the software interrupt is set to the kernel priority. */
///        _IPR( _ICU_SWINT ) = configKERNEL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY;

        /* Start the first task. */
        prvStartFirstTask();
    }

    /* Should not get here. */
    return pdFAIL;
}
```

- In "vApplicationSetupTimerInterrupt();", we also set up the software interrupt.
- So, we comment out the SWINT-related settings.
- We don't need to include the "iodefine.h" because we don't access the SWINT-related resources.
- In the application, after the timer-related (CMT) settings are finished, the SWINT-related settings are done.

```
    void vApplicationSetupTimerInterrupt(void)
    {
        uint8_t intr = configKERNEL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY;
        cmt_.start(configTICK_RATE_HZ, intr, vTickISR);

        device::icu_mgr::set_task(device::ICU::VECTOR::SWINT, vSoftwareInterruptISR);
        device::icu_mgr::set_level(device::ICU::VECTOR::SWINT, configKERNEL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY);
    }
```

### portmacro.h

- Source/portable/GCC/RX600/portmacro.h
- Source/portable/GCC/RX600v2/portmacro.h
- Source/portable/GCC/RX700v3_DPFPU/portmacro.h

```
#define portYIELD()                         \
    __asm volatile                          \
    (                                       \
        "PUSH.L R10                 \n"     \
        "MOV.L  #0x872E0, R10       \n"     \
        "MOV.B  #0x1, [R10]         \n"     \
        "MOV.L  [R10], R10          \n"     \
        "POP    R10                 \n"     \
    )

```
Previously, I used "CMP [R10].UB, R10" because "MOV.L [R10], R10" was strange.   However
But the original code is prioritized and restored.   
I think this 32-bit transfer is a bad idea because it violates the precautions in the hardware manual.   
It may be a structural problem with the RX microcomputer, so it may make sense to do so.   
I've asked this question before, but I haven't gotten a clear answer as to why it's happening.

## Sample Programs

- In the sample, it outputs a string over a serial connection.
- Different microcontrollers use different channels, so check the settings in main.cpp.
- The sample program creates and launches three tasks.
- Task1 outputs a count value every 500 milliseconds
- Task2 outputs a count every 100 milliseconds
- Task3 outputs a count every 1000 milliseconds

The FrrRTOS uses a timer interrupt CMT as a hardware resource.

In this example, we have assigned CMT0.

```
    typedef device::cmt_mgr<device::CMT0> CMT;
    CMT         cmt_;
```

The setting is done in the "vApplicationSetupTimerInterrupt" function called from FreeRTOS.   
It is a timer interrupt of 1000 Hz (1 ms).
